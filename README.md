The code is attached to the paper "Non-Relativistic Effects in Hawking Radiation: Applications to Pion and Axion Production," which will be published on arXiv. 

It is written on Mathematica 13.1, and can generate the Hawking radiation spectrum $\frac{dN}{dtd\omega}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{\Gamma_{\omega}}{e^{\omega/T_H}-1}$, where $\Gamma_{\omega}$ is the greybody factor with the contribution from angular momentum summed over, and the cross section $\sigma=\frac{\pi}{(\omega v)^2} \sum_{l}(2l+1)|T_{\omega l}|^2=\frac{\pi}{(\omega v)^2} \Gamma_{\omega}$ for scalar particles with any masses in a Schwarzschild spacetime.
The corresponding plots are Figs. 3 and 4 in the paper.
