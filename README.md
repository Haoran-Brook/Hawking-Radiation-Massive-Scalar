# HawNS - HAWking radiation of Nonrelativistic Scalars
## Authors: Haoran Cui, Yuhsin Tsai, Tao Xun
This code is attached to the paper "Hawking radiation of nonrelativistic scalars: applications to pion and axion production," based on Mathematica 13.1. 

The code is self-consistent and requires no extensions or input data. It can generate the Hawking radiation spectrum $\frac{dN}{dtd\omega}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{\Gamma_{\omega}}{e^{\omega/T_H}-1}$, where $\Gamma_{\omega}$ is the greybody factor with the contribution from angular momentum summed over, and the cross section $\sigma=\frac{\pi}{(\omega v)^2} \sum_{l}(2l+1)|T_{\omega l}|^2=\frac{\pi}{(\omega v)^2} \Gamma_{\omega}$ for scalar particles with any masses in a Schwarzschild spacetime. The code can be modified for more general black holes like Kerr black holes.

The corresponding plots are Figs. 3 and 4 in the paper.
